                        You know I always wondered how someone ran through all the those job applications in order to pick someone for a job. How would they look? Would they go by credentials, the school you attended, or maybe look at your past experiences, even the skills you say you have. How many people have they looked through I wonder? How do they choose? I thought about it and came to the conclusion that what really matters is if you stick out from others. It matters how you write your application on how it'd be appealing; in other words a form of "play". It's as if the person is acting in front of you and your trying to pick the best character. Maybe this person has a nice voice with lots of experience, another shows great emotion with great skill, and so on; Yet their are a couple that stick out, the ones that don't do what everyone else is doing they could be terrible at singing and acting yet they are interesting. It's sort of refreshing in a way it grabs your attention and I just wonder if I am an eye sore for another person or did I grab your attention?
